# SaaS Agent Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating the AI agentic system with the SaaS platform. The integration will allow SaaS users to access AI agents based on their subscription tier, providing a seamless experience for event planning assistance.

## Current Status

The SaaS platform and AI agentic system have been partially integrated. The following components are in place:

1. **Backend Components**:
   - Tenant-aware agent factory
   - Agent router with tenant context
   - API endpoints for agent interaction
   - Subscription-based access control

2. **Frontend Components**:
   - Agent dashboard page
   - Agent chat interface
   - Agent selection based on subscription tier
   - JavaScript services for API communication

3. **Authentication**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Tenant context extraction from headers

## Integration Issues Fixed

We've addressed the following issues to make the integration work:

1. **Authentication Bypass for Demo**:
   - Modified `auth/dependencies.py` to bypass token validation for demo purposes
   - Added dummy token generation in `auth.js` for frontend authentication

2. **Tenant Context**:
   - Added tenant ID header in `agent-service.js` to provide organization context
   - Modified middleware to extract tenant ID from headers

3. **Subscription Checks**:
   - Modified `subscription/feature_control.py` to allow access to all agent types for demo purposes

## Remaining Tasks

The following tasks still need to be completed for a production-ready integration:

1. **Authentication**:
   - Implement proper authentication flow with API calls
   - Add token refresh mechanism
   - Secure API endpoints with proper validation

2. **Database Integration**:
   - Ensure tenant data is properly stored and retrieved
   - Implement proper database migrations for SaaS-specific tables

3. **Subscription Management**:
   - Implement proper subscription tier checks
   - Add payment processing integration
   - Implement usage tracking and limits

4. **User Experience**:
   - Improve error handling and messaging
   - Add loading states and progress indicators
   - Implement proper conversation history management

5. **Testing**:
   - Add comprehensive test suite for SaaS-specific functionality
   - Test with multiple tenants and subscription tiers
   - Load testing for concurrent users

6. **Deployment**:
   - Configure production environment
   - Set up monitoring and logging
   - Implement backup and recovery procedures

## Architecture

The integration follows a multi-tenant architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend**:
   - SaaS-specific UI components
   - Agent chat interface
   - Authentication and session management

2. **Backend**:
   - Tenant-aware middleware
   - Subscription-based access control
   - Agent routing and management

3. **Database**:
   - Multi-tenant data storage
   - Conversation history
   - User and organization management

4. **AI System**:
   - Agent graphs and state management
   - LLM integration
   - Tool usage and external API access

## Implementation Details

### Tenant Context

The tenant context is passed through the system using the following mechanisms:

1. **Frontend to Backend**:
   - The organization ID is stored in localStorage
   - The `X-Tenant-ID` header is included in all API requests

2. **Backend Processing**:
   - Middleware extracts tenant ID from headers
   - Tenant ID is passed to agent factory and state manager
   - Agent state includes organization context

### Subscription Control

Access to agents is controlled based on subscription tier:

1. **Tier Levels**:
   - Free: Coordinator, Resource Planning
   - Professional: Adds Financial, Stakeholder, Marketing, Project Management
   - Enterprise: Adds Analytics, Compliance & Security

2. **Feature Control**:
   - `SubscriptionFeatureControl` class manages access checks
   - Agent factory requires access before creating agents
   - API endpoints return appropriate error messages for unavailable features

### State Management

Agent state is managed with tenant context:

1. **State Storage**:
   - `TenantAwareStateManager` stores conversation state
   - State is partitioned by organization ID
   - Conversations are isolated between tenants

2. **Conversation History**:
   - Conversations are stored with tenant context
   - API endpoints filter conversations by tenant
   - UI displays only relevant conversations

## Testing

The integration can be tested using the following methods:

1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Log in with different user accounts
   - Test agent access based on subscription tier
   - Verify conversation isolation between tenants

2. **Automated Testing**:
   - Unit tests for tenant-aware components
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for user flows

## Conclusion

The SaaS agent integration provides a powerful extension to the event planning platform, allowing users to access AI assistance based on their subscription tier. The multi-tenant architecture ensures proper isolation and security, while the subscription-based access control enables monetization of advanced agent capabilities.
