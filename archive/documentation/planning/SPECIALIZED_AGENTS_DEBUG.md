# Debugging Specialized Agents in AI-EventPlanner

## Issue Description

The specialized agents in the AI-EventPlanner system are not responding when the coordinator agent delegates tasks to them. The coordinator agent successfully transitions to the implementation phase when the user approves the proposal, but no agent assignments are created.

## Investigation

1. **Coordinator Graph Phase Transition**
   - The coordinator graph successfully transitions from `information_collection` to `implementation` phase when the user approves the proposal.
   - This transition is triggered by the code added to the `assess_request` function that checks for the phrase "approve" and "proposal" in the user's message.

2. **Delegate Tasks Function**
   - The `delegate_tasks` function is called when the coordinator graph transitions to the implementation phase.
   - The function is supposed to create agent assignments and delegate tasks to specialized agents.
   - However, no agent assignments are being created during the test.

3. **Agent Assignments Initialization**
   - The `delegate_tasks` function does not initialize the `agent_assignments` list if it doesn't exist in the state.
   - This could be causing the issue if the `agent_assignments` list is not being created before the function tries to append to it.

4. **Task Delegation**
   - The `delegate_tasks` function uses the LLM to determine which tasks to delegate to which agents.
   - It then tries to append these assignments to the `agent_assignments` list.
   - However, if the `agent_assignments` list is not initialized, this would fail.

## Solution

1. **Initialize Agent Assignments**
   - Add code to the `delegate_tasks` function to initialize the `agent_assignments` list if it doesn't exist in the state.
   ```python
   if "agent_assignments" not in state:
       state["agent_assignments"] = []
   ```

2. **Fix Indentation Issues**
   - Ensure that the code is properly indented to avoid syntax errors.

3. **Test the Solution**
   - Run the test again to see if the specialized agents are now invoked when the user approves the proposal.

## Results

After implementing the solution, the coordinator graph successfully transitions to the implementation phase when the user approves the proposal. However, there are still issues with the delegate_tasks function that prevent agent assignments from being created.

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate the LLM Response**
   - Check if the LLM is returning a valid JSON response that can be parsed by the delegate_tasks function.

2. **Debug the Task Delegation Process**
   - Add more logging to the delegate_tasks function to see where it's failing.

3. **Simplify the Task Delegation Process**
   - Consider simplifying the task delegation process to make it more robust.
