# Coordinator Agent Context Retention Fix

## Problem
The coordinator agent was not retaining context between interactions, causing it to ask the same questions repeatedly and not reference previous user preferences or decisions.

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive conversation memory system that tracks user preferences, decisions, clarifications, and recommendations throughout the conversation.

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/utils/conversation_memory.py` (Created)
- **ConversationMemory class**: Core memory management system
- **Key Features**:
  - Tracks user preferences with confidence levels
  - Records decisions with reasoning and alternatives
  - Stores clarifications and their context
  - Manages recommendation acceptance/rejection
  - Provides context summaries and relevant context retrieval
  - Determines when to reference previous context

### 2. `app/graphs/coordinator_graph.py` (Modified)
- **System Prompt Enhancement**: Added conversation memory context to the system prompt
- **Memory Integration**: 
  - Initialize conversation memory in `create_initial_state()`
  - Pass conversation context to all LLM interactions
  - Enhanced `gather_requirements()` to use memory context
  - Updated `generate_response()` to include conversation memory
- **Context-Aware Instructions**: Updated prompts to check memory before asking questions

### 3. `app/tools/coordinator_search_tool.py` (Fixed)
- **Pydantic Compatibility**: Fixed field naming issue (`_search_service` → `search_service_instance`)
- **Lazy Initialization**: Proper initialization of search service

## Key Improvements

### 1. Memory Tracking
```python
# Track user preferences
memory.track_user_preference("event_type", "corporate conference", confidence=0.9)

# Track decisions
memory.track_decision("venue_selection", "Moscone Center", "User prefers large venues", alternatives)

# Track clarifications
memory.track_clarification("How many attendees?", "500 people", "Event scale requirements")
```

### 2. Context-Aware Responses
- System prompt now includes: `CONVERSATION MEMORY CONTEXT: {conversation_context}`
- Instructions to check memory before asking questions
- Reference previous context appropriately

### 3. Conversation Continuity
- Avoids repeating questions that have been answered
- References user preferences and decisions
- Maintains conversation flow across interactions

## Test Results

The test script `test_coordinator_memory_fix.py` validates:

✅ **ConversationMemory Class Functionality**
- User preference tracking
- Decision recording
- Clarification management
- Context retrieval

✅ **Coordinator Agent Integration**
- Memory initialization in state
- Context retention between interactions
- Appropriate referencing of previous information
- Avoidance of repeated questions

## Example Conversation Flow

```
User: "Hi, I need help planning a corporate conference for about 500 people in San Francisco."
Coordinator: [Acknowledges and starts gathering requirements]

User: "What's the budget range for this type of event?"
Coordinator: [References the corporate conference for 500 people in San Francisco]

User: "Our budget is around $75,000 for the entire event."
Coordinator: [Acknowledges budget for the corporate conference]

User: "What type of event are we planning again?"
Coordinator: "You mentioned earlier that you're planning a corporate conference for around 500 people in San Francisco..."
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: No more repetitive questions
2. **Better Context Awareness**: Agent remembers user preferences and decisions
3. **Smoother Conversations**: Natural flow with appropriate references
4. **Efficient Planning**: Faster progression through requirements gathering
5. **Personalized Responses**: Tailored recommendations based on memory

## Technical Implementation

### Memory Structure
```python
{
    "user_preferences": {
        "event_type": {"value": "corporate conference", "confidence": 0.9, "timestamp": "..."}
    },
    "decisions": [
        {
            "decision_type": "venue_selection",
            "decision": "Moscone Center",
            "reasoning": "User prefers large venues",
            "alternatives_considered": ["Hotel A", "Hotel B"],
            "timestamp": "..."
        }
    ],
    "clarifications": [...],
    "recommendations": [...],
    "topic_history": [...]
}
```

### Context Integration
- Memory context is injected into system prompts
- LLM receives conversation history and memory context
- Responses are generated with full awareness of previous interactions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistent Memory**: Store conversation memory in database for long-term retention
2. **Advanced Context Retrieval**: Implement semantic search for relevant context
3. **Memory Compression**: Summarize old conversations to manage memory size
4. **Multi-Session Memory**: Track preferences across multiple planning sessions
5. **Learning Patterns**: Identify user patterns and preferences over time

## Conclusion

The coordinator agent now successfully retains context between interactions, providing a much more natural and efficient event planning experience. The conversation memory system ensures that users don't have to repeat information and that the agent can make informed decisions based on the full conversation history.
