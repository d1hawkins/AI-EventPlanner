### Development Tools

1. **Static File Server**
   - Created `serve_saas_static.py` - Simple HTTP server for testing the SaaS application

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components

All frontend components follow these design principles:
- Responsive design using Bootstrap 5
- Accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
- Consistent styling and UI patterns
- Error handling and user feedback
- Form validation

### JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript files implement:
- Event handling for user interactions
- Form submission and validation
- Dynamic content loading
- Modal dialogs for confirmations and forms
- API integration (simulated for now)

### Backend Integration Points

The frontend components are designed to integrate with these backend endpoints:
- Team management API
- Subscription and billing API
- User settings API
- Authentication and security API

## Testing

To test the SaaS application:

1. Run the static file server:
   ```
   python serve_saas_static.py
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/saas/
   ```

3. Test the following pages:
   - Team management: `/saas/team.html` and `/saas/team-invite.html`
   - Subscription management: `/saas/subscription.html`
   - User settings: `/saas/settings.html`

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Implement actual API endpoints for the frontend components
   - Connect to database for persistent storage
   - Implement authentication and authorization

2. **Testing and Validation**
   - Comprehensive testing of all features
   - Security testing
   - Performance optimization

3. **Deployment**
   - Prepare for production deployment
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Documentation and user guides
