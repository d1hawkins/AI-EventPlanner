# Azure Subscription Issue and Solution

## Problem Identified

When attempting to deploy the AI Event Planner SaaS application to Azure using the `deploy-app-to-azure.sh` script, the following error occurred:

```
Error: App Service 'ai-event-planner-saas' does not exist in resource group 'ai-event-planner-rg'.
Please run the full azure-deploy-saas.sh script first to create all required resources.
```

When attempting to run the `azure-deploy-saas.sh` script to create the required resources, the following error occurred:

```
(ReadOnlyDisabledSubscription) The subscription is disabled and therefore marked as read only. You cannot perform any write actions on this subscription until it is re-enabled.
```

## Root Cause

Both Azure subscriptions available in your account are currently disabled for write operations:

1. Subscription ID: `13e630db-8816-46b8-896e-511fab75a53a` (SNT - David H)
2. Subscription ID: `d2c43e35-6777-462e-8d34-0bef08261edd` (Visual Studio Professional with MSDN)

This prevents the creation of any Azure resources required for deployment.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Re-enable Azure Subscription

1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to Subscriptions
3. Select the subscription you want to use
4. If the subscription is disabled, look for an option to re-enable it
5. You may need to update payment information or resolve any billing issues

### Option 2: Run the Application Locally

Until the Azure subscription issue is resolved, you can run the application locally using one of the following methods:

#### A. Run with Python directly:

```bash
python run_saas_with_agents.py
```

This will:
- Load environment variables from `.env.saas`
- Start the FastAPI application on port 8002
- Enable hot-reloading for development

#### B. Run with Docker:

```bash
./run_saas_docker.sh
```

This will:
- Build a Docker image using `Dockerfile.saas`
- Run the container with environment variables from `.env`
- Expose the application on port 8000

### Option 3: Deploy to a Different Cloud Provider

If Azure subscription issues persist, consider deploying to an alternative cloud provider:

1. **Heroku**: Offers free and paid tiers with simple deployment
2. **DigitalOcean**: Provides App Platform for easy deployment
3. **AWS**: Offers various services like Elastic Beanstalk for Python applications
4. **Google Cloud**: Provides App Engine for Python applications

## Next Steps

1. Attempt to resolve the Azure subscription issue by contacting Azure support or updating billing information
2. In the meantime, use the local deployment options to continue development and testing
3. Once the subscription is re-enabled, run the `azure-deploy-saas.sh` script to create all required resources
4. Then run the `deploy-app-to-azure.sh` script to deploy the application

## Local Development URLs

When running locally:
- Python direct: http://localhost:8002/static/saas/index.html
- Docker: http://localhost:8000/static/saas/index.html
