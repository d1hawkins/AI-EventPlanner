# Azure Deployment Fixes

This document outlines the fixes for the two issues encountered with the Azure deployment of the AI Event Planner SaaS application:

1. Database tables not being created
2. Agents giving mock responses instead of real responses

## Issue 1: Database Tables Not Being Created

The original deployment script was using hardcoded database connection parameters in the migration script, which caused the database tables not to be created properly. We've fixed this by:

1. Creating an updated version of `run_azure_migrations_fixed.py` that uses environment variables for database connection
2. Adding a fallback mechanism to create tables directly using SQLAlchemy models if migrations fail
3. Implementing better error handling and logging for database operations

## Issue 2: Agents Giving Mock Responses

The original app adapter was not properly importing and using the real agent implementations. We've fixed this by:

1. Creating an enhanced version of `app_adapter_with_agents.py` with better error handling
2. Adding multiple import paths to try different ways of importing the agent modules
3. Implementing detailed logging to help diagnose import issues
4. Adding a flag to indicate when real agents are being used vs. mock responses

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy these fixes, follow these steps:

1. Make sure all the fixed files are in place:
   - `run_azure_migrations_fixed_updated.py`
   - `scripts/create_azure_tables_direct_fixed_updated.py`
   - `app_adapter_with_agents_fixed.py`
   - `deploy-saas-with-fixes.sh`
   - `complete-deployment.sh`

2. Make the deployment scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy-saas-with-fixes.sh
   chmod +x complete-deployment.sh
   ```

3. Run the complete deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./complete-deployment.sh
   ```

4. The script will:
   - Make the necessary scripts executable
   - Copy the fixed app_adapter_with_agents.py to the deployment directory
   - Run the deployment script with the fixes

5. After deployment, verify that:
   - Database tables are created properly
   - Agents are giving real responses instead of mock responses

## Verification

To verify that the fixes are working:

1. Check the Azure App Service logs for successful database table creation
2. Test the agents through the web interface to confirm they're giving real responses
3. Look for the "using_real_agent": true flag in the API responses

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Azure App Service logs for error messages
2. Verify that the DATABASE_URL environment variable is set correctly
3. Ensure that all required Python packages are installed
4. Check that the app_adapter_with_agents.py file is being used correctly
