# Azure Deployment Solution

I've attempted to deploy the AI Event Planner SaaS application to Azure using multiple approaches, but encountered persistent issues with the deployment. The main challenge was the application's dependency on packages like `uvicorn` that weren't being properly installed in the Azure App Service environment.

## Deployment Scripts Created

1. **Python-based Deployment** (`azure-deploy-saas-python.sh`):
   - Used Azure App Service's built-in Python configuration
   - Explicitly included all required packages in the requirements.txt file
   - Created a startup script that installs the required packages and starts the application

2. **Node.js-based Deployment** (`azure-deploy-static.sh`):
   - Created a simple Node.js server to serve static files
   - Included the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files

3. **Static HTML Deployment** (`azure-deploy-html-fixed.sh`):
   - Created a simple static HTML website
   - Used Azure App Service's built-in static site hosting capabilities

4. **Docker-based Deployment** (`azure-deploy-docker.sh`):
   - Created a script that builds a Docker image using the existing Dockerfile.saas
   - Pushes the image to Azure Container Registry
   - Deploys the image to Azure App Service

## Key Issues Encountered

The main issue was that the Azure App Service Python environment doesn't automatically install packages from requirements.txt. Despite attempts to create a startup script that installs the packages, the application still failed to start with the error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'uvicorn'`.

## Recommended Solution

The Docker-based approach (`azure-deploy-docker.sh`) is the most promising solution because:

1. It uses the existing Dockerfile.saas which already has all the necessary dependencies installed
2. It provides a consistent environment between development and production
3. It avoids the package installation issues encountered with the other approaches

To deploy the application using the Docker-based approach:

```bash
chmod +x azure-deploy-docker.sh
./azure-deploy-docker.sh
```

This script will:
1. Create an Azure Container Registry
2. Build and push the Docker image
3. Create an App Service Plan and Web App
4. Configure the Web App to use the Docker image
5. Restart the Web App

The application should then be accessible at:
