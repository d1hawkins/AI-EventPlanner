# Azure Docker Deployment Security Fix

This document explains the security fixes and improvements made to the Docker deployment process for the AI Event Planner SaaS application in Azure.

## Issues Identified

1. **Security Vulnerability**: The original Dockerfile embedded sensitive data (API keys, database credentials) in the Docker image layers through ARG and ENV instructions.
2. **Database Connection Issues**: The database setup scripts used hardcoded database connection parameters instead of reading from environment variables.
3. **Error Handling**: The entrypoint script lacked proper error handling and retry logic, causing the container to fail silently.
4. **Resource Naming**: Some Azure resource names contained spaces, causing CLI command failures.

## Files Fixed

1. **Dockerfile.saas.fixed**: 
   - Removed all ARG/ENV instructions for sensitive data
   - Uses an external entrypoint script instead of an inline script
   - Installs additional dependencies required for Pydantic email validation

2. **entrypoint.sh**:
   - Robust error handling and logging
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff for database operations
   - Continues application startup even if database setup fails
   - Properly handles environment variables

3. **scripts/create_azure_tables_direct_fixed.py**:
   - Uses DATABASE_URL environment variable instead of hardcoded credentials
   - Includes retry logic for database connections
   - Properly formats Azure PostgreSQL username

4. **scripts/setup_azure_db_complete_fixed.py**:
   - Uses the fixed database scripts
   - Includes retry logic for command execution
   - Passes environment variables to child processes

5. **azure-deploy-docker.sh.fixed**:
   - Uses resource names without spaces
   - Sets environment variables as App Service settings instead of build arguments
   - Properly handles secrets from .env.saas file

6. **.github/workflows/azure-deploy-docker.yml.fixed**:
   - Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use the fixed Dockerfile
   - Uses resource names without spaces
   - Sets environment variables as App Service settings

## How to Apply the Fixes

Run the helper script:
```bash
./apply_docker_security_fixes.sh
```

This will:
- Back up your original files
- Replace them with the fixed versions
- Make the necessary scripts executable

## Security Improvements

1. **Secrets Management**: Sensitive data is no longer embedded in Docker image layers, making it more secure.
2. **Runtime Configuration**: Environment variables are set at runtime via App Service settings.
3. **Error Resilience**: Improved error handling and retry logic makes the application more robust.
4. **Logging**: Better logging helps diagnose issues during container startup.

## Deployment Process

After applying the fixes, deploy to Azure using:
```bash
./azure-deploy-docker.sh
```

The deployment process:
1. Builds the Docker image without sensitive data
2. Pushes the image to Azure Container Registry
3. Creates or updates the App Service Plan and Web App
4. Sets environment variables as App Service settings
5. Restarts the Web App

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check App Service Logs**: In the Azure Portal, go to your App Service > Monitoring > Log stream
2. **Check Environment Variables**: Make sure all required environment variables are set in App Service settings
3. **Check Database Connection**: Verify that the DATABASE_URL is correct and the database is accessible from Azure
4. **Check Container Registry**: Verify that the container image was pushed successfully

## Additional Notes

- The application will now read all configuration from environment variables at runtime
- The database setup scripts will retry database operations if they fail
- The application will start even if database setup fails, allowing for manual database setup if needed
- The Dockerfile now installs the `email-validator` package required by Pydantic for email validation
