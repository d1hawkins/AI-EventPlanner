# Event Planning System - Common Use Cases Analysis

Following The Method's principles from the IDesign approach, we need to identify the core, common use cases that will support all current and future functionality. These should be behavioral patterns that transcend specific features and represent fundamental system operations.

## Core Common Use Cases

1. **Tenant-Scoped Data Access**
   - Every operation in the system must respect tenant boundaries
   - All data queries and mutations must be filtered by tenant context
   - Core behavior pattern supporting multi-tenancy across all features
   - Example behaviors:
     * Filtering queries by tenant ID
     * Validating tenant context on writes
     * Managing tenant-specific configurations

2. **Resource State Management**
   - Common pattern for managing lifecycle states of various entities
   - Applies to events, tasks, payments, contracts, etc.
   - Consistent state transition logic across different resource types
   - Example behaviors:
     * Draft → Active → Completed → Archived
     * Pending → Approved → Fulfilled
     * Created → In Progress → Resolved

3. **Stakeholder Communication**
   - Universal pattern for managing communications between different parties
   - Supports all types of stakeholder interactions
   - Handles notifications, messages, and updates
   - Example behaviors:
     * Sending notifications
     * Managing message threads
     * Handling real-time updates
     * Tracking communication history

4. **Financial Transaction Processing**
   - Common pattern for handling all monetary transactions
   - Supports payments, refunds, donations, and sponsorships
   - Manages financial records and audit trails
   - Example behaviors:
     * Processing payments
     * Managing escrow
     * Handling refunds
     * Recording financial transactions

5. **Document Management**
   - Universal pattern for handling all types of documents
   - Supports contracts, marketing materials, presentations, etc.
   - Manages versioning and access control
   - Example behaviors:
     * Storing documents
     * Managing versions
     * Controlling access
     * Tracking changes

6. **Access Control and Authorization**
   - Common pattern for managing permissions and access rights
   - Applies to all secured resources and operations
   - Handles role-based access control
   - Example behaviors:
     * Checking permissions
     * Managing roles
     * Enforcing access rules
     * Auditing access

7. **Scheduling and Timeline Management**
   - Universal pattern for managing temporal aspects
   - Supports events, tasks, meetings, deadlines
   - Handles scheduling conflicts and dependencies
   - Example behaviors:
     * Managing schedules
     * Handling conflicts
     * Tracking deadlines
     * Managing dependencies

8. **Resource Allocation**
   - Common pattern for managing limited resources
   - Applies to venues, equipment, staff, volunteers
   - Handles capacity and availability
   - Example behaviors:
     * Checking availability
     * Reserving resources
     * Managing conflicts
     * Tracking utilization

9. **Activity Tracking and Analytics**
   - Universal pattern for monitoring and analyzing system usage
   - Supports reporting and insights across all features
   - Handles metrics and performance indicators
   - Example behaviors:
     * Recording activities
     * Generating reports
     * Calculating metrics
     * Providing insights

## Analysis and Rationale

These common use cases were identified based on several key factors:

1. **Frequency of Occurrence**
   - These patterns appear repeatedly across different features
   - They represent fundamental operations that support multiple functionalities

2. **Architectural Significance**
   - Each pattern has significant architectural implications
   - They influence major design decisions and system structure

3. **Business Value**
   - These patterns directly support core business requirements
   - They enable essential business operations and workflows

4. **Future Extensibility**
   - The patterns are flexible enough to support future enhancements
   - They can accommodate new features and requirements

## Validation Against Requirements

These common use cases support all 55 specific use cases from the requirements document. For example:

- Tenant Registration (Use Case #1) relies on Tenant-Scoped Data Access and Access Control
- Event Creation (Use Case #3) uses Resource State Management and Scheduling
- Service Provider Booking (Use Case #5) involves Resource Allocation and Financial Transactions
- Sponsor Management (Use Case #6) uses Stakeholder Communication and Document Management
- Task Assignment (Use Case #11) relies on Resource State Management and Activity Tracking

The common use cases provide a foundation that can be composed and combined to support both current and future specific use cases, following The Method's principle of identifying volatile areas and encapsulating them appropriately.
