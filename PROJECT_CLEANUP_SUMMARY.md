# Project Structure Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the major cleanup and reorganization of the AI Event Planner project structure completed on July 31, 2025.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Archive Structure
- Created `archive/legacy/` directory to store all non-essential files
- Organized archived content into logical subdirectories:
  - `archive/legacy/backups/` - All backup files (*.backup*, *.backup_*)
  - `archive/legacy/deprecated/` - Deprecated deployment scripts and configs
  - `archive/legacy/environments/` - Old environment configuration files
  - `archive/legacy/scripts/` - Legacy scripts and utilities
  - `archive/legacy/deploy_temp_*/` - Temporary deployment directories
  - Various deployment archives and logs

### 2. Files Moved to Archive

#### Backup Files
- All `*.backup` and `*.backup_*` files from throughout the project
- Multiple versions of coordinator graph backups
- Agent factory backups
- Communication tools backups
- Middleware backups

#### Deprecated Deployment Scripts
- Over 50 Azure deployment scripts and variations
- Docker deployment configurations
- Legacy requirements files
- Old startup scripts and configurations

#### Environment Files
- Multiple `.env.*` template and sample files
- Legacy environment configurations
- Test environment files

#### Legacy Scripts and Utilities
- Development and testing scripts
- Database setup and migration scripts
- Agent testing and debugging utilities
- Deployment helper scripts

#### Temporary Deployment Directories
- Multiple `deploy_temp_*` directories containing deployment snapshots
- Archive deployment packages and logs

### 3. Current Clean Structure
The main project directory now contains only:
- **Core Application Code** (`app/` directory)
- **Active Configuration Files** (current `.env` files, `requirements.txt`, etc.)
- **Essential Scripts** (`scripts/` directory with current utilities)
- **Documentation** (README files, current deployment guides)
- **Active Deployment Scripts** (current Azure deployment script)
- **Tests** (`tests/` directory)
- **Migration Files** (`migrations/` directory)

### 4. Key Benefits
- **Reduced Clutter**: Main directory is now clean and focused
- **Improved Navigation**: Easier to find current, relevant files
- **Preserved History**: All legacy files are preserved in archive for reference
- **Better Organization**: Logical separation of active vs. historical files
- **Deployment Ready**: Clean structure suitable for production deployment

### 5. Archive Contents Summary
- **Total Archived Items**: 200+ files and directories
- **Backup Files**: 20+ backup files moved to `archive/legacy/backups/`
- **Deployment Scripts**: 50+ legacy deployment scripts
- **Environment Files**: 10+ environment configuration files
- **Legacy Scripts**: 100+ development and utility scripts
- **Deployment Snapshots**: Multiple temporary deployment directories

## Current Active Deployment Script
The project now uses a single, clean deployment script:
- `azure-deploy-real-agents-final-v3-with-tenant-conversations.sh`

## Archive Access
All archived files remain accessible in the `archive/legacy/` directory structure for:
- Historical reference
- Recovery of specific configurations if needed
- Understanding project evolution
- Debugging legacy issues

## Next Steps
With the clean project structure in place, the project is now ready for:
- Production deployment using the active deployment script
- Easier maintenance and development
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved developer onboarding experience
