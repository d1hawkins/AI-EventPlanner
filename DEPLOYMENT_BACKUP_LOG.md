# Deployment Backup Log

## Backup Created: 2025-06-28

### Files Backed Up:
- `azure-deploy-complete-saas-with-agents.sh` â†’ `azure-deploy-complete-saas-with-agents.sh.backup`

### Purpose:
Backup created before implementing conversational agent deployment improvements as outlined in AZURE_CONVERSATIONAL_AGENT_DEPLOYMENT_TASK.md

### Current Deployment Behavior (for rollback reference):
- Uses `app_adapter_standalone.py` as main application
- Copies basic files without full app directory structure
- Uses embedded simple agent logic instead of real conversational coordinator graph
- Missing conversational utilities (question_manager, recommendation_engine, etc.)

### Rollback Instructions:
If deployment fails, restore with:
```bash
cp azure-deploy-complete-saas-with-agents.sh.backup azure-deploy-complete-saas-with-agents.sh
./azure-deploy-complete-saas-with-agents.sh
```

### Next Steps:
1. Update deployment script to include conversational agent components
2. Create conversational-enabled main application
3. Test and validate conversational flow in Azure
