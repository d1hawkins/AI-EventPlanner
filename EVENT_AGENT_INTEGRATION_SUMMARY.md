# Event-Agent Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Event-Agent Integration feature for the AI Event Planner SaaS application. The feature allows users to attach events to agent conversations, enabling agents to access event context in their responses.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoint

Added a new endpoint in `app/agents/api_router.py` for attaching events to conversations:

```python
@router.post("/agents/attach-event", response_model=AttachEventResponse)
async def attach_event_to_conversation(
    request: Request,
    attach_request: AttachEventRequest = Body(...),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user_id: int = Depends(get_current_user)
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Implementation details...
```

This endpoint:
- Verifies that the conversation exists and belongs to the current organization
- Gets the event from the database
- Updates the conversation state with event context
- Adds a system message about the attached event
- Returns a success message

### 2. Agent Factory Updates

Modified `app/agents/agent_factory.py` to load event data into agent context:

- Updated the `create_agent` method to accept an optional `event_id` parameter
- Added code to load event data from the database if `event_id` is provided
- Modified all agent creation methods to include event context in the agent state
- Added code to update existing conversations with event context when an event is attached

### 3. Frontend UI Implementation

Updated the frontend UI to support attaching events to conversations:

- Added a new method in `app/web/static/saas/js/agent-service.js` for attaching events to conversations:

```javascript
async attachEventToConversation(conversationId, eventId) {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

- Added a new method in `app/web/static/saas/js/agent-service.js` for getting events:

```javascript
async getEvents() {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

- Implemented the UI for the attach event modal in `app/web/static/saas/js/agent-ui.js`:

```javascript
function showAttachEventModal() {
    // Implementation details...
}

function attachEventToConversation(eventId) {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

### 4. Testing

Created a test script `test_event_agent_integration.py` to verify the Event-Agent Integration feature:

- Tests creating a new event
- Tests starting a conversation with the coordinator agent
- Tests attaching the event to the conversation
- Tests sending a message that references the event to verify context

## Verification

The implementation was verified by:

1. Running the test script `test_event_agent_integration.py`
2. Manually testing the feature through the UI
3. Checking that agents can access event context in their responses

## Conclusion

The Event-Agent Integration feature has been successfully implemented, allowing users to attach events to agent conversations and enabling agents to access event context in their responses. This enhances the agent's ability to provide relevant and contextual assistance for event planning.
