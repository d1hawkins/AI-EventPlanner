# Azure Real Agents Fix Tasks - CORRECTED ROOT CAUSE

**Status**: ‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - GOOGLE AI IS WORKING PERFECTLY  
**Date**: 2025-06-21  
**Priority**: HIGH  

## üéØ BREAKTHROUGH: ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED

After comprehensive diagnostics, the **REAL issue** has been identified:

### ‚úÖ AZURE GOOGLE AI CONFIGURATION IS WORKING PERFECTLY

**Diagnostic Results from `test_azure_google_api.py`:**
- **Azure Google API Key**: `AIzaSyBnxHGPQ70mgUPu...` ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL
- **Generative AI API Status**: ‚úÖ ENABLED (50 models available)
- **LangChain Test Call**: ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL ("Hello, this is a test from Azure!")
- **API Response**: 200 OK with full model access

**Previous Assumption**: ‚ùå WRONG - Google AI API was assumed to be disabled  
**Reality**: ‚úÖ Google AI is fully functional in Azure environment

### üîç ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE: APPLICATION-LEVEL FAILURES

The "mock responses" are actually **error handling fallback messages** from agent communication tools when agent graphs fail to execute properly in Azure. Key issues identified:

1. **Agent Graph Execution Failures**: Agent graphs fail due to missing dependencies or environment differences
2. **Database Connection Issues**: "Not an executable object: 'SELECT 1'" error in Azure
3. **Missing Environment Variables**: TAVILY_API_KEY missing, causing search tool failures
4. **Error Handling Fallbacks**: When agents fail, error handling returns generic messages that appear as "mock responses"

### üìä DIAGNOSTIC EVIDENCE

**Local Environment (Working)**:
- Google API Key: `AIzaSyBgdKgwJYyQTJEW...` (Project 424217536561 - API DISABLED)
- Agents: Working with real AI responses

**Azure Environment (Failing)**:
- Google API Key: `AIzaSyBnxHGPQ70mgUPu...` (Different project - API ENABLED)
- Agents: Returning error fallback messages perceived as "mock responses"

## üîß TASK 1: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Rewrite AZURE_REAL_AGENTS_FIX_TASKS.md

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Description**: Document has been rewritten with correct root cause analysis.

**Key Changes**:
- ‚ùå Removed incorrect Google AI configuration fixes
- ‚úÖ Added correct root cause: application-level failures
- ‚úÖ Updated with diagnostic evidence
- ‚úÖ Focused on actual technical issues

## üîß TASK 2: Fix the Actual Technical Issues Causing Agent Failures

**Status**: üîÑ PENDING  
**Priority**: HIGH  

### 2.1 Fix Database Connection Issues

**Issue**: "Not an executable object: 'SELECT 1'" error in Azure  
**Impact**: Prevents agent state persistence and database operations  

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Investigate Azure database connection configuration
- [ ] Fix SQL execution issues in Azure environment
- [ ] Test database connectivity with agent operations
- [ ] Verify agent state persistence functionality

**Files to Check**:
- `app/db/session.py`
- `app/state/manager.py`
- `app/state/tenant_aware_manager.py`

### 2.2 Add Missing Environment Variables

**Issue**: TAVILY_API_KEY missing, causing search tool failures  
**Impact**: Search functionality in agents fails, triggering error responses  

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Add TAVILY_API_KEY to Azure App Service environment variables
- [ ] Test search tool functionality with valid API key
- [ ] Verify all required environment variables are present

**Azure Configuration**:
```bash
# Add to Azure App Service Configuration
TAVILY_API_KEY=<your_tavily_api_key>
```

### 2.3 Fix Agent Graph Dependencies

**Issue**: Some agent graphs fail due to missing dependencies or import issues  
**Impact**: Agent execution fails, returning error messages instead of AI responses  

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Audit all agent graph dependencies
- [ ] Ensure all required packages are installed in Azure
- [ ] Fix any import or dependency issues
- [ ] Test individual agent graph creation and execution

**Files to Check**:
- `app/graphs/resource_planning_graph.py`
- `app/graphs/financial_graph.py`
- `app/graphs/stakeholder_management_graph.py`
- `app/graphs/marketing_communications_graph.py`
- `app/graphs/project_management_graph.py`
- `app/graphs/analytics_graph.py`
- `app/graphs/compliance_security_graph.py`

### 2.4 Improve Error Handling and Logging

**Issue**: Error messages are generic and don't clearly indicate technical failures  
**Impact**: Users perceive error fallbacks as "mock responses"  

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Enhance error messages to be more specific
- [ ] Add better logging for agent failures
- [ ] Distinguish between technical errors and actual mock responses
- [ ] Implement proper error reporting to users

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/tools/agent_communication_tools.py`
- `app/utils/logging_utils.py`

## üîß TASK 3: Test Agents in Azure to Verify Real AI Responses

**Status**: üîÑ PENDING  
**Priority**: HIGH  

### 3.1 Create Azure Agent Testing Script

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Create comprehensive agent testing script for Azure
- [ ] Test each agent type individually
- [ ] Verify real AI responses vs. error messages
- [ ] Document test results

**Script Requirements**:
```python
# test_azure_agents_comprehensive.py
# - Test each agent graph creation
# - Test agent invocation with real tasks
# - Verify AI responses are generated
# - Check for error conditions
# - Report success/failure for each agent
```

### 3.2 End-to-End Agent Testing

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Test coordinator agent with real user interactions
- [ ] Test task delegation to specialized agents
- [ ] Verify agent communication and results
- [ ] Confirm no mock responses are returned

### 3.3 Performance and Reliability Testing

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Test agent response times in Azure
