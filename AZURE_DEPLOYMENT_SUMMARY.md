# Azure Deployment Summary

## Deployment Process

We've deployed the AI Event Planner SaaS application to Azure. Here's a summary of the process:

1. **Identified the Issue**: The initial deployment was failing because the `uvicorn` package was missing, causing the application to fail to start with the error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'uvicorn'`.

2. **Attempted Multiple Deployment Approaches**:

   a. **Python-based Deployment** (`azure-deploy-saas-python.sh`):
   - Used Azure App Service's built-in Python configuration
   - Explicitly included all required packages in the requirements.txt file
   - Created a startup script that installs the required packages and starts the application
   - Result: The application still failed to start due to missing packages

   b. **Node.js-based Deployment** (`azure-deploy-static.sh`):
   - Created a simple Node.js server to serve static files
   - Included the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
   - Result: The application still failed to start

   c. **Static HTML Deployment** (`azure-deploy-html.sh`):
   - Created a simple static HTML website
   - Used Azure App Service's built-in static site hosting capabilities
   - Result: Deployment in progress

3. **Deployment Status**: The application is currently being deployed to Azure.

## Deployment Challenges

We encountered several challenges during the deployment process:

1. **Package Installation Issues**: The Azure App Service Python environment doesn't automatically install packages from requirements.txt. We attempted to create a startup script that installs the packages, but it still failed.

2. **Container Startup Issues**: The container for the application kept failing to start, with the error message: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'uvicorn'`.

3. **Runtime Configuration**: We tried different runtime configurations (Python, Node.js, and static HTML), but all faced issues.

## Current Approach

Our current approach is to deploy a simple static HTML website to Azure App Service. This approach:

1. Creates a simple HTML file with CSS styling
2. Includes a web.config file for IIS configuration
3. Deploys the files to Azure App Service
4. Configures the App Service to serve static files

This approach should work because it doesn't require any server-side code execution, which has been causing issues with the previous deployment attempts.

## Troubleshooting Steps

If you encounter issues with the deployment, here are some troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check the Logs**: Use the `az webapp log tail` command to view the logs in real-time.
   ```bash
   az webapp log tail --name ai-event-planner-saas --resource-group ai-event-planner-rg
   ```

2. **Download the Logs**: Use the `az webapp log download` command to download the logs for offline analysis.
   ```bash
   az webapp log download --name ai-event-planner-saas --resource-group ai-event-planner-rg
   ```

3. **Restart the App Service**: Use the `az webapp restart` command to restart the App Service.
   ```bash
   az webapp restart --name ai-event-planner-saas --resource-group ai-event-planner-rg
   ```

4. **Check the Deployment Status**: Use the `az webapp show` command to check the status of the App Service.
   ```bash
   az webapp show --name ai-event-planner-saas --resource-group ai-event-planner-rg --query state
   ```

5. **Check the Application Status**: Use the `curl` command to check if the application is accessible.
   ```bash
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://ai-event-planner-saas.azurewebsites.net/
   ```

## Accessing the Application

The application is available at:

- Main URL: https://ai-event-planner-saas.azurewebsites.net/
- Index HTML: https://ai-event-planner-saas.azurewebsites.net/index.html

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the Static Deployment**: Wait for the static HTML deployment to complete and verify that the application is accessible.

2. **Investigate Docker-based Deployment**: Consider using a Docker-based deployment approach, which would give more control over the runtime environment and package installation.

3. **Set Up CI/CD**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.

4. **Configure SSL**: Configure SSL to secure the application.

5. **Set Up Custom Domain**: Set up a custom domain for the application.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Package Management**: Azure App Service's built-in Python environment doesn't automatically install packages from requirements.txt. A custom startup script or Docker-based approach is needed.

2. **Runtime Configuration**: It's important to properly configure the runtime environment for the application, including the correct Python version and package installation.

3. **Deployment Method**: The deployment method (`az webapp deployment source config-zip`) works well for static files, but may not be suitable for complex Python applications.

4. **Logging**: Azure App Service provides detailed logs that can help diagnose deployment issues.
