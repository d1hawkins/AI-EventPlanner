# Azure Deployment Solution

I've created multiple approaches for deploying the AI Event Planner SaaS application to Azure:

## 1. Docker-based Deployment via GitHub Actions

Since Docker isn't running on your local machine, I've created a GitHub Actions workflow that handles the Docker-based deployment:

- **Workflow file**: `.github/workflows/azure-deploy-docker.yml`
- **Credentials**: Generated Azure service principal credentials in `AZURE_CREDENTIALS.json`

To use this approach:
1. Add the contents of `AZURE_CREDENTIALS.json` as a GitHub repository secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`
2. Go to your GitHub repository's Actions tab
3. Run the "Deploy to Azure with Docker" workflow

This approach is recommended because:
- It uses the existing `Dockerfile.saas` which properly installs all dependencies
- The build happens in GitHub's CI/CD environment, not on your local machine
- It provides a consistent environment between development and production

## 2. Static HTML Deployment

For a simpler approach, I've created a static HTML deployment script:
- **Script**: `azure-deploy-html-fixed.sh`

This deploys a simple static website to Azure App Service, which can serve as a placeholder until the full application is deployed.

## Documentation

I've created several documentation files:
- **AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_FINAL.md**: Summary of deployment approaches and recommendations
- **AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_GITHUB_ACTIONS.md**: Detailed instructions for GitHub Actions deployment
- **AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_RESULTS.md**: Summary of deployment attempts and issues
- **AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md**: Detailed deployment summary

## Next Steps

1. Add the Azure credentials to your GitHub repository secrets
2. Run the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the application
3. Monitor the deployment in the GitHub Actions tab
4. Once deployed, the application will be available at:
   - https://ai-event-planner-saas.azurewebsites.net/
   - https://ai-event-planner-saas.azurewebsites.net/static/saas/index.html
