# Azure Deployment Results

## Deployment Status

We've attempted to deploy the AI Event Planner SaaS application to Azure App Service. Despite multiple approaches, we've encountered persistent issues with the deployment.

## Approaches Tried

1. **Python-based Deployment**:
   - Used Azure App Service's built-in Python configuration
   - Explicitly included all required packages in the requirements.txt file
   - Created a startup script that installs the required packages and starts the application
   - Result: The application failed to start due to missing packages, specifically `uvicorn`

2. **Node.js-based Deployment**:
   - Created a simple Node.js server to serve static files
   - Included the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
   - Result: The application failed to start

3. **Static HTML Deployment**:
   - Created a simple static HTML website
   - Used Azure App Service's built-in static site hosting capabilities
   - Result: The application is still not accessible

4. **Configuration Changes**:
   - Changed the runtime stack to `STATICSITE|1.0`
   - Set environment variables to enable app service storage
   - Set the port to 8080
   - Restarted the app service
   - Result: The application is still returning a 503 error

## Key Issues Encountered

1. **Package Installation**: The Azure App Service Python environment doesn't automatically install packages from requirements.txt. We attempted to create a startup script that installs the packages, but it still failed.

2. **Container Startup Issues**: The container for the application kept failing to start, with the error message: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'uvicorn'`.

3. **Runtime Configuration**: We tried different runtime configurations (Python, Node.js, and static HTML), but all faced issues.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Docker-based Deployment**: Consider using a Docker-based deployment approach, which would give more control over the runtime environment and package installation. The Dockerfile in the project could be used for this purpose.

2. **Azure Functions**: For a serverless approach, consider using Azure Functions, which might be more suitable for this type of application.

3. **Azure Container Instances**: Deploy the application as a container using Azure Container Instances, which provides more flexibility than App Service.

4. **Local Environment Testing**: Before deploying to Azure, test the application in a local environment that mimics the Azure environment to identify and resolve issues.

## Conclusion

The deployment of the AI Event Planner SaaS application to Azure App Service has been challenging due to issues with package installation and runtime configuration. A Docker-based approach or using Azure Container Instances might be more suitable for this application.
