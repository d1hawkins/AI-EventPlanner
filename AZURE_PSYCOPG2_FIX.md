# Azure Psycopg2 Fix

## Issue

After fixing the auth directory issue, we encountered another error:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'
```

This error occurred when trying to import the psycopg2 package, which is a PostgreSQL adapter for Python. This package is required for the SQLAlchemy database connection.

## Root Cause

The psycopg2 package was not being installed correctly in the Azure App Service. The startup.sh script was installing several packages, but it was not explicitly installing the psycopg2 package.

## Fix

We made the following changes to fix the psycopg2 package issue:

1. Modified the `startup.sh` script to include the psycopg2-binary package in the list of packages to install:

```bash
# Install required dependencies
echo "Installing dependencies..."
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install fastapi uvicorn gunicorn sqlalchemy pydantic langchain langgraph google-generativeai openai passlib python-jose python-multipart bcrypt python-dotenv psycopg2-binary
```

2. Created a script to check if the psycopg2 package is installed in the Azure App Service and install it if it's not.

3. Updated the verification scripts to check if the psycopg2 package is installed.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the fix:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of the startup.sh script with the psycopg2-binary package included in the list of packages to install.
2. Run the update-azure-agents.sh script to deploy the updated files to Azure:

```bash
./update-azure-agents.sh
```

3. Monitor the deployment logs to ensure that the psycopg2 package is properly installed.
4. Verify that the application is running correctly by accessing the application URL.

## Verification

After deploying the fix, you should see the following in the deployment logs:

1. The psycopg2-binary package being installed:
   ```
   Installing psycopg2-binary...
   ```

2. No ModuleNotFoundError for psycopg2 in the application logs.

### Verification Scripts

A verification script has been created to check if the psycopg2 package is installed in the Azure App Service. The script connects to the Azure App Service using SSH and checks if the psycopg2 package is installed.

To run the verification script:

```bash
chmod +x check_psycopg2_installation.py
./check_psycopg2_installation.py
```

The script will:
1. Check if the psycopg2 package is installed in the Azure App Service
2. If not installed, install it
3. Verify that the installation was successful

## Conclusion

The issue was caused by a missing dependency in the Azure App Service. By adding the psycopg2-binary package to the list of packages to install in the startup.sh script, we were able to fix the issue and ensure that the application can properly connect to the PostgreSQL database.

The verification script provides an additional tool to ensure that the psycopg2 package is installed correctly in the Azure App Service.
