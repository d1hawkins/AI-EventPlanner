# Azure Deployment Solution

I've created a comprehensive solution for deploying the AI Event Planner SaaS application to Azure. After encountering issues with Docker not running on your local machine, I've implemented a GitHub Actions-based deployment approach.

## Key Files Created

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: `.github/workflows/azure-deploy-docker.yml`
   - Builds and deploys the Docker image using GitHub's CI/CD environment
   - Configures the Azure App Service with the necessary settings

2. **Azure Service Principal**: `AZURE_CREDENTIALS.json`
   - Contains the credentials needed for GitHub Actions to authenticate with Azure
   - Should be added as a secret in your GitHub repository

3. **Documentation**:
   - `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md` - Overview of the deployment solution
   - `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_GITHUB_ACTIONS.md` - Detailed instructions for GitHub Actions deployment
   - `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_FINAL.md` - Summary of deployment approaches
   - `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_RESULTS.md` - Summary of deployment attempts and issues
   - `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed deployment summary

## Deployment Instructions

1. Add the Azure credentials to your GitHub repository:
   - Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add a new repository secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`
   - Copy the contents of `AZURE_CREDENTIALS.json` as the value

2. Run the GitHub Actions workflow:
   - Go to your GitHub repository → Actions
   - Select the "Deploy to Azure with Docker" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"

3. Monitor the deployment in the GitHub Actions tab

4. Once deployed, the application will be available at:
   - https://ai-event-planner-saas.azurewebsites.net/
   - https://ai-event-planner-saas.azurewebsites.net/static/saas/index.html

This approach leverages GitHub's CI/CD environment to build and deploy the Docker container, avoiding the need for Docker to be running on your local machine. It uses the existing `Dockerfile.saas` which properly installs all dependencies, providing a consistent environment between development and production.
